# dPCR-dataset
Bechmarked dataset for digital PCR

Digital PCR (dPCR), an evolution of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), has broadened the horizons of molecular biology, offering the capability of absolute quantification of templates. However, the complexity and diversity of dPCR applications necessitate comprehensive, reliable, and accessible resources for effective data management and interpretation. 

To address these challenges, we introduce the "MGIDP - Benchmark Modified Generated Digital PCR Database and Automatic Classification Model." This resource consolidates data from real experiments, including 4,992 ddPCR and 21,019 microwell dPCR images, as well as images generated using our Synthetic Image Generator (SIG) algorithm. 

Validated using real images, MGIDP captures the diversity of dPCR experiments, promoting enhanced model performance. It can be utilized in both supervised and semi-supervised training scenarios, demonstrating competitiveness across various training settings.
