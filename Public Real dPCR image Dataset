The Public Real dPCR Image Dataset consists of dPCR images obtained from actual pre-clinical experiments, including 4,992 ddPCR and 21,019 microwell dPCR images(256Ã—256x3). 

Both droplet dPCR images and microwell dPCR images demonstrate different sample concentrations and types of amplified templates, thereby displaying varied ratios of positive reactors. 

This assortment of images, reflecting different applications and experimental conditions, underscores the robustness and generalization capability of our database, thereby promoting reproducibility, collaboration, and education within the scientific community.

The experiment are conducted by Prof. Ho-Pui Ho, Prof. Yi-Ping Ho, Prof. Wu Yuan's labs (Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong) and Prof. Mingli You's lab (School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University).
