The Benchmarked Real dPCR Image Dataset consists of dPCR images obtained from actual experiments conducted in wet labs, along with human annotated data. 

The microreactors, including droplets and microwells, have been classified into positive and negative classes using bounding boxes.

For each microreactor, the data provides information on its size, coordinates, and class. 

Link 1 (Update by Shanhang) contains 206 droplet dPCR images that have been labeled, while link 2 (Update by Shanhang) contains 144 labeled microwell dPCR images.
